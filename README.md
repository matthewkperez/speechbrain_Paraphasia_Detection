# Introduction
We present a novel E2E approach for automatic paraphasia detection. The model uses a seq2seq architecture nad has two separate heads for ASR and paraphasia detection output. We show that optimizing for both ASR and paraphasia detection objectives via multitask learning yields an optimal model for word-level and utterance-level paraphasia detection.
